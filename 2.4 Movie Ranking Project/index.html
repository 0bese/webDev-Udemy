<h1> The Best Movies According to 0bese </h1>
<h2> My top 3 shows of all time. </h2>

<hr />

<h3> Game of Thrones </h3>
<p> 
    The fact that they director could make you fall in love with any character yet he/she still could die.
</p>

<h3> Harry Potter </h3>
<p>
    Don't know if this counts as a show but, I loved every single part that was released.
</p>

<h3> Prison Break </h3>
<p>
    This is just a great show. I just couldnt choose between this and a couple others so I just wrote this there anyways.
